We are a sports analytics agency who´s aim is to identify best European basketball talent for the NBA. Our project´s goal was to highlight statistical differences where Europeans stand out, we identified countries in Europe to look out for and we delivered an easy-to-use dashboard in Tableau for our clients to search for prospect players for their teams.
