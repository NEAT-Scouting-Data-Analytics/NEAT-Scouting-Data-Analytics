<h2> Project Goal and Scope </h2>  

Our project aims to highlight statistical differences where European basketball players stand out compared to their US and international counterparts. Utilizing two major data sources publicly available from **NBA.com** and **Basketball.Realgm.com**, we will focus on identifying specific European countries to watch for emerging talent. The deliverable will be an easy-to-use Tableau dashboard, enabling clients to search for suitable prospects effectively.

<h2> Caveat </h2>  

Please note that this project is non-profit and is aimed merely to simulate a real-life example. 



The project has been finalised. Full project description shall follow shortly :hammer:. Stay tuned!
