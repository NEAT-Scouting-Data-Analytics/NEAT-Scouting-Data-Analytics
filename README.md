<h2> Project Goal and Scope </h2>  

Our project aims to highlight statistical differences where European basketball players stand out compared to their US and international counterparts. Utilizing two major data sources publicly available from **NBA.com** and **Basketball.Realgm.com**, we will focus on identifying specific European countries to watch for emerging talent. The deliverable will be an easy-to-use Tableau dashboard, enabling clients to search for suitable prospects effectively.

<h2> Caveat </h2>:exclamation:

***Please note that this project is non-profit and intended solely to simulate a real-life scenario for educational purposes. The data scraped from NBA.com and Basketball.Realgm.com has not been used for any commercial purposes. The scenario of a scouting agency is entirely fictional, created to fulfill the requirements of a capstone project.***



The project has been finalised. Full project description shall follow shortly :hammer:. Stay tuned!
